I'm an assistant professor in the [Linguistics Department](https://www.ling.upenn.edu) at the University of Pennsylvania and the director of the [Child Language Lab](https://childlanglab.com).  

I teach a graduate seminar in [psycholinguistics](/ling607), an undergraduate course in [language and the brain](/ling104) and a crossover course in [neurolinguistics](https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/YWZxdZBxNSam92CL6oZQNptm). Occasionally, I also teach [LING 1](/ling001), Penn's Introduction to Linguistics.
